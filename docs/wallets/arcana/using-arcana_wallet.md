# Using Arcana Wallet

Arcana wallet is a non-custodial, embedded Web3 wallet that is automatically enabled for a user once the user logs into a Web3 app that is integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK.

Arcana Auth allows users to easily onboard Web3 apps using Web2 logins, social providers and custom IAM authentication services. 

To use the Arcana Wallet, you need to log in to an app that is integrated with the Arcana Auth SDK. After successful authentication, users can perform any supported Web3 wallet operations using the Arcana wallet UI.

See [Arcana Wallet User Guide](https://docs.dev.arcana.network/user-guides/wallet-ui/index.html) for details.
