# Introduction

Web3 application developers can enable the embedded, non-custodial Web3 wallet to their users by integrating with the Arcana Auth SDK. 

The Arcana wallet offers a user-friendly, secure, and customizable interface that can be branded to match the application styling. Users do not need to install a browser extension to use the wallet or generate or manage cryptographic keys. The wallet is built using the state-of-the-art asynchronous, distributed key generation protocol which allows users to have full control over their wallets and abstracts the complexity of cryptography.

By default, Shardeum Sphinx 1.x network is already pre-configured in the Arcana wallet. Users can manually add other Shardeum chains using the wallet UI. App developers can programmatically add other Shardeum chains or other EVM-compatible blockchains such that they are displayed as default when a user logs into the app and the wallet is displayed in the app's context.

For more details, see [Arcana Wallet Users Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/user-guides/wallet-ui/index.html) and [Developers Guide for enabling the Arcana Wallet](https://docs.arcana.network/auth-quick-start.html) in a Web3 app.
